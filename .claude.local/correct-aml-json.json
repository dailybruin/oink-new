Alongside the Olympic swimmer stood other athletes from Team USA awaiting the Parade of Nations during the Opening Ceremony, the dazzling presentation that begins the games and introduces participants to global audiences. As tradition, the host country entered last. To Leamy, the long wait was laborious. But then, as the athletes turned the corner of the iconic stadium, the energy transformed. The crowd erupted in excitement."

The LA Olympic Organizing Committee had commissioned Academy Award-winner John Williams to compose the Olympic fanfare played at the event. It surged through the air with triumphant crescendos, carrying the weight of human achievement, cooperation and preparation for the 16-day athletic festival."

Surrounding her were bandmates from universities across the country – including UCLA and the University of Southern California  – united for one purpose. As the ensemble played music, she could feel the crowd’s vigor. After the athletes and musicians had taken their places, Bruin track and field champion Rafer Johnson received the final flame of the Olympic torch relay and ascended the Coliseum stairs to light the Olympic cauldron – the same one used when the Summer Games were first held in LA in 1932. In doing so, he became the first African American to light the cauldron."

UCLA is set to play a central role by hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Village – the residential complex that will accommodate thousands of athletes. Beyond the bustle of the dorms, the Rose Bowl will host soccer events and become the second venue in history – after the Coliseum – to be used in the Olympic Games three times. As preparations ensue and the games become an ever-closer reality, UCLA alumni reflect on their experiences as part of the Bruin community in 1984."

Displays painted in vivid hues of aqua, magenta and tangerine were placed around UCLA’s campus to capture Southern California’s essence. The Drake Stadium concourse featured shops and concession stands that overlooked the field, which was adorned with the Flags of Nations and held daily ceremonies. In Simonian’s eyes, the disruption of the games on student life was not negative because it was too valuable of an opportunity to miss."

The Rose Bowl hosted the gold medal men’s soccer match between France and Brazil with more than 101,000 people in attendance, breaking the record for the largest crowd to watch a soccer game in the U.S. or Canada at the time. The 1984 Games also featured a variety of other venues in Southern California, including Dodger Stadium, the Forum and the Anaheim Convention Center.
