At a research institution, discovery doesn’t happen in a vacuum. In the undergraduate physics lounge, first-years ask upperclassmen for help on problem sets. Weekly colloquiums with visiting researchers take place on the Physics and Astronomy Building’s patio. Decades-long research collides with fresh perspectives and experiences as professors invite undergraduate and graduate students into their labs."

In comparison, national statistics as of 2021 showed that women earned 25% of physics bachelor’s degrees, according to the American Physical Society and the American Institute of Physics. Additionally, 33% of astronomy bachelor’s degrees are earned by women, according to the American Institute of Physics.
